aursia,FACTION,"Formed by Domain-era settlers whom identified and familiarized to each other by a cultural identity called ""Aursians"" - supposedly an generalisation of few major Old Earth and Domain cultures. Hosting several more subcultures who each speak different accents of different languages spoken in the Persean sector. After the collapse, some polities on the fringe watched in distraught on the disparity of what the political landscape had become and the economical ruin. In a quick bid, they pleaded to federalize together and agree on their own doctrine that fit their view of the world and the future - which clashed with Luddites and Hegemony. The Aursian Federation's worldview are polar opposites to theirs; technology the future and wasn't at fault of the Collapse and the Hegemon interpretation of Domain and the future is compared to necrophilia. As they say.

As a result, they are perhaps one of the opimistic and leninent factions in the sector, who invest more in welfare, industry, and technology than in questions on about conquest and grudging. In the core, the federation suffer disagreements and selfish interests at expense of others, making them rather slow and squabbling compared to others. They are nonetheless the will of the people.",,,,,,,

anubis_planet_ebba_desc,CUSTOM,"A life-viable candidate that once lacked water to support a large society. Several cycles of planned bombardment of ice towed from the midrim ring has given the planet the water essential for flourishing life and potential to become a like of the old home as human history remembers it. The Collapse has been an inconvenience for the terraforming, but even with rusty technology, it is none outside the power of the ambitious inhabitants. It has only been delayed with few years, as how they put it.",,,,,,,
anubis_station_yukon_desc,CUSTOM,"Erected to serve as the centre of coordinaton for the terraforming project on Ebba, it has been extended to entice more visitors to come and visit, once again to support the rush of miners to exploit the deposits discovered on the planet. Today, the lastest extension so far is the arrays of weaponry and defenses against the pirate menance and the ""orange-collars"".    ",,,,,,,
anubis_planet_tarantula_desc,CUSTOM,"Squatting on the edge of the green zone, the planet proved to be difficult and challenging for settlers. At climax of doubts about the planet, discovery of the plentiful exploitable resources in the crust has secured humanity an economical hub with a propserious future, now distant without the gates. Despite the history, Tarantula's circumstances has proved to be pivotal on the present day politics in the sector.",,,,,,,
anubis_station_porta_desc,CUSTOM,"Truly one of the jewels of a foregone era, this megaport orbital sports impressive rows of teeth to dissuade attacks on the station or the world it orbits. This gem still keeps the cut from the old times, if not worn out from cycles of service and careful maintenance replacing the old parts with new. It's the Odysssy of space stations, still serving the same purpose as before.",,,,,,,
anubis_station_nevestapol_desc,CUSTOM,"Built to exploit the resources sitting on the surface of Atlas, and to exploit the trade route connecting Percules with other systems unfortunate to not have gates, Nevestopol was known for chartering visitors and providing cheap fuel.

anubis_planet_castillo_desc,CUSTOM,"Hiding volatives resources required to manufacture fuel under the surfacial glacier crust. Colonies were founded to exploit this resource and to construct industry to strengthen the economy of Percules.

They were scooped up by pirates, who set them in the path of pirates.",,,,,,,
anubis_station_amanda_desc,CUSTOM,"An extension of the Castillo colony, Amanda Orbital housed a fraction of the population and offered depots and facilities required for the operations on the surface, services and accessibility for the settlements grafted into the surfaces. The old defense grid, built to protect against debris and crash-course rocks, has been retrofit with salvaged military technology and hangar bays.",,,,,,,

anubis_station_haven_desc,CUSTOM,"Once built to be a construction platform to build a deep-space colony, the project was forced into abandonment by the Collapse. War and remains of naval actions has left scrap and debris ripe for exploit, prospectors used this platform as a depot for their operations. Now, it has become a full-ledged miniaturized astropolis fit with facilities for scrapping old ships into bolts, plates, and components; from where they gain new destiny in the market.",,,,,,,
anubis_planet_medina_desc,CUSTOM,"One of the targets of colonization, Medina was once a thriving and fruitful garden. It was able to sustain itself on its own after the apocalysptical events of the Collapse. However, it had attracted the attention of the more radical Luddites and green eyes of envy. Wars of conquest has ravaged the fertile soil sterile and containmented with toxic pollutants, then a wave of ""salvation and redemption"" was brought over the planet. The planet barely sustains the population unfortunate to be still alive.",,,,,,,
anubis_station_anderson_desc,CUSTOM,"Built to suppliment the local system with more ore and provide pre-Collapse researchers space to commit to their research in, it was abandoned due to expenses exceeding the profits. The husk of former golden times has provided a band of pirates a somewhat secluded and cozy residence, from where they can continue their plunderings and raids.",,,,,,,
